I'm going to practise a bit of Scala for this advent.



Requirements (TBC):
1. install sbt
1. install conscript: http://www.foundweekends.org/conscript/
1. run: `cs sbt/sbt` 
1. you can now run these .sh scripts

### Day 1
Complete!  I've learned that you can use Scala in a shell script.  I've not worked out how to import from local packages into these scripts.  Maybe in the days ahead some of these things will become clear.

Scala is good at recursion and the solution I used makes use of Scala's tail recursion feature

### Day 2
